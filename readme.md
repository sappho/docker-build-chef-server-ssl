# Sample Docker Image Build

This repository is a suppliment to [docker-build-chef-server](https://github.com/sappho/docker-build-chef-server). It's intended as a starting point for building a private Docker image. Please feel free to fork it, but do remember to keep your forked repository private to protect your private key.

Paste your private key into `ssl/chef-server.key` and a certificate bundle into `ssl/chef-server.crt`. Note that both must be nginx compatible.
